Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n *\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n *\n * For example:\n *\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n * ```solidity\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\n *         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n *     }\n * }\n *\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n *     }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n *\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n *\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n * contract, which may impact the proxy.

@dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed\n behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n For example:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```solidity\n contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n     function initialize() initializer public {\n         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n     }\n }\n contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n     }\n }\n ```\n TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n [CAUTION]\n ====\n Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\n the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```\n /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n constructor() {\n     _disableInitializers();\n }\n ```\n

Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized. For example: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```solidity contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {     function initialize() initializer public {         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");     } } contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");     } } ``` TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:

IMPORTANT: A proxy pointing at a proxiable contract should not be considered proxiable itself, because this risks bricking a proxy that upgrades to it, by delegating to itself until out of gas. Thus it is critical that this function revert if invoked through a proxy. This is guaranteed by the `notDelegated` modifier.\"},\"renounceOwnership()\":{\"details\":\"Leaves the contract without owner. It will not be possible to call `onlyOwner` functions.
